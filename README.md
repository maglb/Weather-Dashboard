# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

For this project, our task was to to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Below are the assigmemnt's requirements:

### User Story

* AS A traveler
* I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
* SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

### Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
* WHEN I search for a city
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
* THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## How to use it

Enter in the search bar the city you would like to get the weather for. Then the window will display the current weather and a 5-Day forecast for the city searched. Each search entry is saved and a button is created for each new search. If you want to get the weather of a city already search directly on the corresponding button and the weather for it will be displayed.
